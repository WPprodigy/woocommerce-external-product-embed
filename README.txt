Provides a shortcode to embed products from another store.

== Description ==

This plugin can be used to connect to another website running WooCommerce, and display products from that site on the site that this plugin is installed on. 

A few notes about this plugin:

*   It requires an admin account for the website running WooCommerce
*   It must make an authorized connection to the external site
*   This plugin stores transients in the wp-options table of your database

== Installation ==

1. Upload `woocommerce-external-product-embed` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of the site you want to display the products on.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Settings > WooCommerce External Products
4. Add in the credentials to connect to external site

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the shortcode for this plugin? =

`[external_product id=“99”]`

= Can I control what gets displayed from the shortcode? =

There are quite a few attributes that can be added to the shortcode. The only required attribute is “id”. Here is an example of all the attributes:

`[external_product id=“99” image=“show” title=“show” price=“show” rating=“show” button=“Custom Text Here”]`

Adding “hide” to any of those attributes will hide that element, including button. 

= Where can I find the “ID” field? =

**Insert Link here**

= Can I add multiple product per shortcode? =

Yep! [external_products id=“10,11,12,13,14,15”]

the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
